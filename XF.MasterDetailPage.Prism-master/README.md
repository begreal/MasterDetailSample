I adjusted few things to show the Xamarin Bug described in my Stackoverflow post here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55722530/burger-button-missing-on-android-when-navigating-further-in-the-navigation-stack

To reproduce the problem in this project, just press the button "Go To ViewB" and you will see on android side that the burger button is not visible

The Actual XF version of this project is 2.5, but this issue also appears on XF 3.4
