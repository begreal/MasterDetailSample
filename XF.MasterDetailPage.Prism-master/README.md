I adjusted few things to show the Xamarin Bug described in my Stackoverflow post here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55722530/burger-button-missing-on-android-when-navigating-further-in-the-navigation-stack

to reproduce the problem in this project, just press the button "Go To ViewB" and you will see on android side that the burger button is not visible
